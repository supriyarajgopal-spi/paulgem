# Foundation Hackathon Oct 28 and 29 - PaulGem

## Scope

- Build an SPP page using Strapi and Next.js
- The SPP that we are trying to reproduce is [orange-bitters-cologne](https://www.jomalone.com/product/25946/90277/colognes/orange-bitters-cologne?size=100ml)
- Deploy and host the application using Varcel.

## Organization

We'll work as part of one of two teams. Each team will try to achive the scope over the duration of the hackathon and learn as much as possible about this tech stack.
- Team 1: Vlad, Supriya, Chris, Maria, Alvaro, Catalin, maybe Florina
- Team 2: Cory, Darren, Patrick, Hernol, Maddy, Leo

Each team will clone the reapo and create a "main" branch for their own team. All of the work will be done on that specific branch.

The teams work can be reviewd against master.

Each team individual can open PR's agains their team branch.
## Quickstart
